If imputation fails due to the following error, follows these steps:
Error: More than 10000 obvious strand flips have been detected. Please check strand. Imputation cannot be started!

#How to fix strand flip error (requires plink formatted files):
  #identify genome build (should have already done this to run imputation in the first place)
    #easiest way is to search for an rsid on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/

  #use this website to identify illumina chip used, input bim file and run:
    #http://mccarthy.well.ox.ac.uk/chipendium/ui/
  
  #download strand data (under strand and position files) - use corresponding chip and genome build:
    #https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~wrayner/strand/index.html
    #use wget to download to your directory
  
  #download the following script:
  wget https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~wrayner/strand/update_build.sh
  
  #run script to convert data to consistent strand/reduce strand flips:
  bash update_build.sh <bed-file-stem> <strand-file> <output-file-stem>
    #<bed-file-stem>	is the name of your binary ped set minus the .bed, .bim or .fam extension
    #<strand-file>	is appropriate strand file for you chip and current strand orientation (TOP, SOURCE, ILMN)
    #<output-file-stem>	is the name of the new output file to create again minus the .bed, .bim or .fam extension
  
  #once updated bed/bim/fam obtained proceed with making vcfs for imputation
